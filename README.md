This is the DIY drumkit interface that we have created for the users to play on.

* The MIDI interfaces is powered and controlled by a Arduino Leonardo micro-controller 
* The wires are connected from the Arduino to the aluminium tape which is use as a conductive sensors for the users to touch. When they touch, it will register the desired tunes for the respective instruments.
